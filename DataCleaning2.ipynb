A Beast Superb Mobile   Fall In Love And But The Delivery Of The Product Is Too Late Bad Delivery Service Flipkart Need To Improve Delivery  But The Redmi K20 Pro Is Jaan Some Samples Belowgood product PUBG HDR+EXTREME graphics setting is superb I Bought the device in Alpha Sale on 17th july Glacier Blue and the device has so premium look to it and and full view display with its amoled panel is very excellent even brightness level is so good and DC Dimming feature is also good  you have separate option to enable Hi-Fi audio output through equalizer setting and InDisplay Figerprint sensor

thought it would be  I\\'m happy i waited patiently instead of getting this from China  Okay first up I\\'m gonna talk about the good and a few bad things about this beast   Good  i  Uber premium

this price   Seriously you won\\'t regret  the Amoled Display is Crispy and has Deep Blacks with good colour production and Colour Accuracy Network Signal Strength is Good  Supports 5ghz Wi-Fi Band  Fast Reboot and Processing Would like to Suggest to go for 6+128 Varient as i don\\'t think that anyone would need more than 6 GB Ram even if play PubG and Multi-task at peak but if you want more storage then Surely go for 8+256 Varient  The Only Con i find t   best performanceTrue Flagship killer phone for 2019  I am doubting to compete this price with this configuration in this year   All

this phone i bought it mainly for gaming PUBG and few other games  1st issue touch is not accurate or sometimes not responsive  Even with game booster it start lags after few minutes of gameplay  No heating issues but i found throttling in performance  Dual GPS is just gimmick do not lock as fast as op6 FM radio receiver so bad  it won\\'t get any stations even after multiple scanning  Front camera is poor  Main camera night shots with night mode not good and   I ordered it on alpha sale but it took a lot time to be delivered  The phone is just awesome every single Penny will worth it  the camera is just fabulous camera detailing is also awesome   talking about the gaming performance  I played pubg classic match in ultra HD setting the battery consumption was only 11% for the entire match   Battery life is also awesome  The design is just beast  It looks and feels so premium in hand  awesome camera only need some improvements towards over exposure battery is awesome if u putup a dark theme I\\'ll last forever call quality is awesome display crisp deep blacks fast processor little multi touch issue which cam be resolved over an update would give 5 stars to value for money if software will be more like stock rather than Miui overall nice pack of specsmistake        playing PUBG and other high intensity games  Cons   1) Back side gets warm while charging  No heating issue are observed while gaming 2) Fingerprint sensor might take a while for those accustomed to physical sensor models 3) Battery drain prominent at the moment, probably it    Lighting conditions  Cons-   1 Some time Battery Drain fast ( some time in heavy usage) (like PUBG Game )  2 Selfie camera average ( vivo v15 selfie camera is Awesome on camparing Redmi k20) 3  Rear camera performing awesome but only in good light conditions , in low light not decent & video satablization not working & when we shoot in Slow motion video Qualit      in this flagship devices , I have taken black color miui is

Feel, Speed, Camera all good  Phone was bought with exchange of an 2 years old phone redmi note 4 , however Flipkart refused to accept it, though the phone was in good condition with only age related wear and tear  Hence my advise  1  Don\\'t go for exchange with flipkart, boz ultimately they wont accept the exchange and you will have to pay exchange price and unnecessarily wait for 10 days  2  Avoid Flipkart, search for the same product on other website an   This phone is a value for money product    everything seems to be spectacular   the camera have to be updated regarding the auto

cons abt this mobile except charger  fast charger have to buy seperately   I used many flagship mobiles which are at high cost but nothing have impressed me as much as this guy  I think untill next year this must be the best flagship in this price range    simply wow Price is little high  why do we buy xioami for 28k when we have nfc,ufs3 0,less weight op7 with 4 k more if has greater buyback guarantee and brand value, Xioami cheated showing wrong expectationsCamera  is decent with its rivals  But it just blows away the mind when used with Gcam  It takes out the best from the phone  If OIS was present then recording videos would have been more stable Selfies are little bit on the softer side Front Cam 8/10, back cam  7/10  Battery  It easily lasts a day with heavy usage playing games on 4g network then using Adobe Photoshop express, calls and every other stuff that we do with mobile  p  I charge it at 9 00 am at 80% it is still 20% at 11 00 pm  10   pros  1 good display good OLED  2 above average battery life(6 to 6 5 SOT for average usage in dual 4 g mode) 3  ok-ok rear cameras if the lightings conditions are good then the 48mp is capable of producing some great results  4  because of SD 855 ,super performance so far   no slow down observed   (6 GB /128gb seems adequate) 5  much improved Xiaomi\\'s s/w (MIUI) in the name of pocco launcher 6 good network receiption   cons  1  front camera seems average (or below average?) the main cul   After waiting for long time    atlast today i received this Awesome phone    K20 pro    superb     very good quality and feels great on hand    need to check in the coming days about its full performance as a flagship phone Please don\\'t see it an overpriced device as it is the cheapest 855 holder in india  Pros -  1)Best camera 48+wide+2x zoom(no useless camera like a depth sensor in OnePlus 7) 2)Display - Super Amoled display is the best in class as Xiaomi has made no compromise 3)Battery-4000 mAh battery will last you for day and a half also it supports 27 watt fast charging which charges it 90 in just one hour(27 waat must buyes separately) 4)Performance- No doubt it even beats the predecessor poco f1 in perf   Camera Excellent But Heating Mobile  Heating Issue When using Mobile Camera heating mobile & Battery DownMy last phone was one plus 5 which still works well without any issues  I thought of exploring a new device and got K20 through the Alpha sale  Though K20 pro is kickass, I felt the weight it carries can become uncomfortable for some  Especially guys like me who were using a pretty light and slim phone   Performance is pretty good and camera is decent  I never expect phone\\'s picture quality to match a DSLR since the latter\\'s sole responsibility is taking pictures  The online review gurus crit   Totally worth it  Initially I was feeling reluctant to buy k20 pro  One plus 7 or Asus 6z was in my mind   This phone was launched as 9t pro in other countries   Checked review and find k20 pro batting horse  Finally my 4th Xiomi phone arrived after using for few days, my review is    WooooW  Negative point   1  In box charger is 9v only   2  Front camera is taking over exposed photo but it is not that bad photos   Seems this can be fixed from software update   However I am not bother about    I got this phone from the ALPHA SALE held by Flipkart-Xiaomi on 17th of July 2019   thanks to Flipkart for delivering this product well within expected time   pros  1  superb screen  it\\'s vibrant, it\\'s immersive, it is beautifully packed inside a very compact chassis   2  The Anti Flicker mode makes your screen flicker-free at low levels of brightness  it Does make a difference if you are sensitive to constant flickering of Amoled screens    3  System-wide dark mode gives you a good feel to t   Superstarsuperb phonehow can anyone say this mobile is overpriced  do not expect a SD 855 lesser than this price   After using it for 4 days I can say this is the best deal you will get in this price rangeawosome,minblowing   superb   Amazing work from radmi  Just go for itCons  *Battery draining fast  *Camera app disappointing    beautify nd AI destroy photos   lacks detailing, faces are turning red and soft, selfies are also bad   grainy too  POCO F1 (my previous phone) is way far better   I had lots of expectations on this one   but seriously disappointed (after 2 days usage)  *Battery draining fast   Pros   *Good speed  *great sound (while using headsets)  *Good Display  *Good touch response  *Excellent for games and watching movies Battery temp goes to 40-42 degree while charging phone display heated on upper screen and down also back panel also heat but little bit camera is just ok not best like oneplus or iphone battery drain very quickly 2 day before my phone camera is also not working but by restart the phone it going back to normal fingerprint sensor is slow not fast phone performance is good no problem in touch but heating issue is a big problem while charging the phone i don\\'t know why its happeningGot my device today   to my surprise the phone is beautiful  It looks and feels very premium  Daylight photography is good but night or low light photos are bad  Front camera is good in daytime and eqaully bad in low light  The call quality is excellent and 3 5 mm jack output is crisp n clear  Camera performance can be improved via update in future though  Phone is fast and display is superb    The major complaint here is I have ordered this phone with exchange offer and the decvice which I w   This review will be helpful for anyone who is currently confused to buy either K20 pro or op7   Verdict- If you are sure that you\\'re going to use the device for minimum of two or more consecutive years then go for OP7   This device is equivalent to OP7 in most parts except for a few which everyone knows about   The main reason to buy Redmi k20 pro over OP7 are  1) Headphone Jack(The audio quality from the Jack is damn amazing  It has a built in HIFI DAC  I used it with my ATH-M50X and it coul   superthe built quality is good but they say they used gorilla glass 5 I don\\'t think so  it catches scratch so easily    display glass very bad  if ur buying k20/pro get the temperglass together with it or dont used untill you get a temperglass  about camera- front camera blowsout background in good light no dynamic range front camera is average 48 mp is good  but wide angle pics edge have fish eye like view  Rest like audio jack is definitely good not up to lg dack Awesome Phone  Camera is So Gd  performance is really Gd  Go for it Awesome Phone Ultimate looks - Carbon black colour is decent (Front and back glass) Fastest processor 855 Perfect camera set-up, 960fps slow motion video is suberb Bright display with 178 degree viewing angle  I don\\'t know why they haven\\'t given IR Blaster  Far better then other flagship phone in this segment Recommendations - Buy K20Pro instead of OnePlus 7  Redmi is providing almost same experience in less price Poor camera quality  The images are full of grains and are very smooth  There is no sharpness at all  My previous POCO phone is much better than k20 pro when it comes to camera quality  Never expected such a quality of photos from this price point  Sometimes you feel like a 15,000 rupees mobile do better in terms of photos I don\\'t know why   but really it has a big heating issue    don\\'t believe in YouTube video\\'s  I played pes 2019 only for 10-20 mi and it\\'s going to very heatedThis phone is a beast in every aspect  Forget OnePlus 7, end of the day both are chinese brands, practically this is the best option buy this blindly you wouldn\\'t regret Its pure beauty & *beast* internally !! just don\\'t think go for it !! u wont regret !! Snapdragon 855 is very fast !! no lag nothing !!! its been 3-4 days & didn\\'t got any issue regarding performance !!  Cameras are very awesome ! u got total of 4 cameras !! Pop up camera is very much awesome and crowd caller !!! it lights up !! 48 megapixels is sooo good !! + wide angle and telephoto are also very good !!!  gaming performance is at new level !  considering the price,this phone is at new leve   I am writing review after use of more than a weak and this device is true killer  Pro  855 snapdragon - You can play PubG in Hdr mode with Extreme frame rate  constant 60 fps Pro camera mode is killer 48 Mp camera beast Wide angle view is pretty good Adrena gpu is also excellent in category Battery backup is also good  Cons No block calls and notification options while playing game 27 w charger is need as normal charger take time to charge device I don\\'t find any other problems  For me Best d   The phone combines all the best features of the current time  Best processor, better camera, better display and best battery life  The phone itself is premium  Battery lasts for about a day nad a half with moderate daily usage  Camera is better  Although the photos it takes are not comparable to Google pixel (natural reproduction of colours) but colours are vibrant and looks preety to the eyes than pixel  Phone is very snappy and no lag is noticed  All in all the phone is best in this price a   This phone is like a beast at this range, Low price but expected a bit more less price, truly its a flagship killer, Front camera üì∑ could have been more better, speed is very good and the most attractive part of this phone is glowing front camera üì∑ and its back  This phone feels like a dragon from GOT just one word for this phone AwesomeCons -   Little bit slow in-display fingerprint (after screen guard) - (compare to oneplus 7)  Front camera could have been better  Night mode of rear camera is not that good Back cover is slippery - It could be transparent one   Pros -   Value for money  Comfortable design Durable - Corning gorilla glass 5 & aluminium frame Good rear camera setup Good battery - Fast Charge  Note  If you are fan of Vanilla android or Oxygen OS than definitely this is not for youawesome phone, value for money   atleast mi should provide earphone for premium phones   1  Display 10/10 2  camera 8/10 3  battery 9/10 -- didn\\'t notice any fast draining yet as others complained 4  processor --10/10awesome mobile by Xiaomi satisfied with it blue beauty with red power button accent is so cool display is awesome but battery is draining fast compared to other xiaomi phonesAmazing Pro mobile  Good Performance and great battery as of now after 4 days of use  Charging cable is of lower quality and short in length  Phone charges fully in 1 5hrs  So far snappy loved it,there are no ad k20 pro and company also says that in k20 pro there will be no ads  phone is good  camera quality is also good  people are saying it\\'s overpriced so u have to understand one thing  k20 pro is expected at 25-26k for 6gb ram 64gb Rom  but tin India , it\\'s base price is 28k for 6gb 128gb Rom  I think redmi k20 is overpriced than k20 pro  NOTE- IF YOU WANT VERY POWERFUL GAMING PHONE AND GREAT BATTERY BACKUP, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO WAIT 1-2 MONTH AND GO FOR ASUS ROG 2 PHON   Phone is Good , Loved the quality of screen and perfomance is awesome Okay so I had waited like for ages to get my hands in this device (at least felt like that for me üòÅ)  I had made up my mind to go with the pro version beforehand hence I ordered the 6/128 carbon black version as I was not sure about the flashy red and blue versions which definitely looks brilliant as well  I am not regretting my decision buying this one and I\\'m extremely satisfied with my purchase   There are plethora of videos and reviews so I\\'m sure everyone knows almost every aspect about   after 3 days of daily uses this is the real killer off flagship phones i think price is 1000-1500 more than we expected with value for money for sure for design and build 5/5 for performance 5/5 for display 5/5 for battery backup and charging 5/5 but i think phone struggle a bit with camera so 3 5 or 4/5 for me this is the best in this price with flagship lvl performance fall in love with this beauty go for it if you need this phone im sure you will be happy for sureEverything is good  but I like stock android more than the miui  finally I made the looks and functions similer to stock and disabled all the ads  Now I am satisfied first I was thinking about OnePlus 7 but then I researched little bit and got this device,Very impressed by this deviceultimate it\\'s worth the weightWell my initial review is as follow -Absolutely Stunning  The display and fit and finish is absolutely top of the line  I was confused betweet OP7 and this one  I guess I made the right choice   There are some software bugs which is very minor and could be fixed using OTA   Overall its a super value for money  Im waiting for the case and tempered glass to arrive then I will use it as a daily driver  BTW will update my review after one month, that will be the final one All the best Team Red   Master of speed  Worth for every penny Loving it   Best in the price  I doubted on Amoled display   but its awsum  No need to believe on fake reviews  Camera stabilization has to be improved a little when compared to other flagships  Not a comenttable con thought  I hope it wud be improved with updates nice deviceawesomeredmi k20 pro is d best phn in the world  27 watt charger should be there in the box which definitely makes it value for money I got this phone for 26000 on icici bank CC initial offerOverall it\\'s worth to buy build quality is good display quality is superb Hi Fi DAC audio playback pretty good Finger print scanner little bit lag Camera quality seems to be good, but need to improveFall in love with it   awesome product from Xiaomigood lookinggood product but not a killerThis phone is a real killer  From the overall performance,camera and display it has been best   each and every components in the hardware section does its job very   leaving some minor aspects which is some software problem    But otherwise worth the deal     I have written camera as best becoz   using google camera and sony\\'s IMX 586 camera does the job at its best   The display is great   But the main issue is with the battery  It drains too fast   Doesn\\'t rly feels like the same that I had in my precious Redmi Note 4  You have to charge it atleast once in a day which is kinda pathetic Don\\'t waste your money if its hard earned its just a phone with gimmicks paid publicity paid preview Display good sound bad No hdr streaming on Netflix possible, no ir blaster  looks good only in dark room otherwise back doesnt attracts in sunlight also idiots have given black cover  so entire design gets hidden save money if you are not fool like meI purchase Redmi K20 Pro 6GB with 128GB variant  When i apply tempered glass on my phone the fingerprint scanner will rarely work  Redmi have already write it on the slippery cover on the Phone itself   Please Consider this when you guys buy it Only Con i found is the delay in fingerprint scanning, and that is expected due to aMoled screen  Rest 10/10 on everything !This phone justifies being called as \"flagship killer\"  I have just become a huge fan of this Alpha flagship phone by xiaomi  Don\\'t think, just go for it K20 pro is a flagship killer on this price  Performance is really very good  18W charger is enough for fast charging works greatMy first flagship phone and it\\'s amazing  Playing all psp games on it without any lag  Camera is fabulous  The case which comes in the box is surprising very good  The only thing bothers me is the screen size  My pervious phone was MI Max 2    I wish the screen was as big as OP7pro, for it would be a perfect phoneoverall very good product with some cons   pros  Excellent design and solid body  good camera very good display but 4k videos from YouTube are not playing fast app launching   cons  slow responsive finger print scanner  lot of adds in between  fussy miui os, lot of customisation, later it can eat the phone performance  multi touch responsive   battery backup is not up to the mark  popup camera responding slow and selfies are average value for moneyONLY ONE WORD THIS PHONE IS A  *BEAST*  MAIN HIGHLIGHT IS THE TRIPLE AI CAMERA  PERFECT SHOTS ON EVERY CONDITION    GAMING ON THIS PHONE IS TOTALLY AWESOME       THE BACK PANEL LOOKS SO PREMIUM      IT HAS GAME TURBO 2 0 AND IN THAT ALL GAMES PERFORMANCE INCREASES     SLOW MOTION ,NIGHT MOD,48 MP MODE , PORTRAIT MODE,PANAROMA,WIDE ANGEL    ARE PRESENT IN CAMERA APP     POP UP CAMERA LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL   I FELL IN LOVE       OMG     awsm k20 pro camera superb   sd 855 super fast   k for killer k for kingummm its good but the YouTube reviewer said it does not get heat its false it does get heat even using cover you could feel the heat  after playing pubg second time continuously the game flicker i played fortnite in auto settings it does not run smooth when you turn around And another bad thing i find is that if you want to change the theme,font or icons it will restart every time And the front camera is not that good and the phone is very slippery if you have sweaty hand but the back cover p   Fingerprint scanner is not accurate and shows poor results  Most often fails to recognise  Bad quality from MI after long time  I have bought many products but disappointed with this Superb phonetouch screen issue  notngood for pubg those who r using claw     i lost all my money with this  bring manu saini in front of me i will take of his brain from his bare headpubg ply smth ultra 40 fps and battry drn fast and also warm handset   some touch problem in multiple touch   finger lock are ok   face lock verry slo  over all if u want to ply hard game pubg plz don\\'t go for it  other wise ok  Value for money is what I can say  Used this phone for 1 day & I have started to like it better  It has a gorgeous display & SD855 makes it run fast enough  Camera is on par with OnePlus  I have been using Mi5 previously, which was running on MIUI10 where K20 pro also runs on the same flavour but with POCO launcher which gives it essence of stock android  I like it  There is lot of room for Software optimisation which I believe Xiaomi will surely do  I like the flat display over the curved di   camera, and fingerprint needs so many improvements, so many bugs, hangs everytime  fingerprint doesn\\'t work properly, failed to open with fingerprint most of the times, case is sleepery  even after update these problems are still there  overall Ph is good  little overpriced  hope after update problems get resolved by redmi no NFC in Indian variant   no reviewer ever stated this   phone by default puts pubg in normal framerate change it in graphics settings   frontcamera has an annoying sound by default and both sounds and lights of front cam can be disabled in settings     photos are good     music is awesome     HDR playback support is now available only in YouTube   back design looks good   * display awesome ****** * Sound good **** * camera performance good in day light and average in low light, hope it will solve in software update **** * Design superb ****** * Performance good ***** * Overall product was good *****Yeah i too have purchased Rk20pro thinking as a flagship phone but when i used it, it doesn\\'t seem to be  like camera  Night photos have too much noise in it  May be it has problem in m6 device only  but I\\'m not happy at all Lots of touch issues with PES 19 and many other appsRead this I got it for 26k but the camera is not that good it could be better battery drains fast but all other performance are good4 starts because the price & the camera   Camera samples are good, but definitely not great  I\\'ve used at least 7 Mi models till now including Poco F1  So, it is not surprising to me that the camera quality is not at all on par with the Xiaomi claims (they say AI and what not)   Price could be 2-3 thousand less as OnePlus 7 is coming for 32K and when you buy during offers, you can get that for 30K itself   Don\\'t get me wrong - K20 Pro is a very good mobile  It\\'s just that I\\'ve expected more c   Pros - - Awesome design - Amoled display - Cameras - both front and back - 4k 60fps recording  - 4k 30fps and below with EIS - Performance - SD855 - enough said! - Sound output on speaker is loud despite being a single speaker - Battery and quick charge - headphone jack  p - price and vfm  Cons - - IR blaster would have been helpful - Bloatware that comes pre installed - 18w charger in box instead of 27w - would have been good if we could upgrade to 27w by paying 200 extra like in China  p -    I just got my phone today   totally satisfied with k20 pro When playing PUBG mobile produce more heatthis is a best best smartphone in this price range 855 snapdragon in most powerful  and camara is very good nice design amulad displayLoved the looks and feel of the phone, there is almot everything as like in a flagship except NFC and Stereo speakers    I felt the phone could have been cheaper than this   That\\'s why 4/5 for value for money   and also the earpiece quality is pretty good on this one At this price range it\\'s a good phone  But camera performance is just a hype  The best thing in the phone is display and chipset  other than that is just a hype I must say that the redmi k20 pro is the best flagship killer phone that money can buy but I have only one complaint that there are no official screenguardz available for the device and I bought a Flipkart smartbuy screen guard which is not of perfect size I would request xiaomi A2 launch official screen tempered glass with         Nice performance & recommended to buyBest value for money! Top end processor! Buttery smooth performance! Can\\'t go wrong with this one UI and camera isn\\'t good  The good thing is it\\'s speed, design, look, performance  But cartoonist UI of MI is not classy and should have better update for camera    plz make good stylish UI and make some good updates in cameraA brief review after one week usage Display  Crystal clear  no doubt with amoled  5/5 Battery   2 days with moderate usage  i charge to 100 % at morning and sleep with 50% left  5/5 Processor  Latest and fastest so no need to explain 5/5 Camera   Superior  When said according to price 5/5 when said according to mentioned 4/5 but believe me you can not find the difference unless you are camera gig   Design  looks premium on hand but slippery to handle  better to use with black case provided o   Good one but exchange option really very very badvalue for moneyfeel the hype the hype is realReally good phone!A premium phone at an affordable price segment is solid deal for the money, a zippy and quicker processor, triple camera excellent displayEverything is fine but I didn‚Äôt understand why redmi is still having issue when using phone while charging though with the original charger  Hope in future they will built a better phone even while charging  Need to improve some security options like hiding lock pattern visibility for default app lock  Rest all is really great really worth waiting  Xiaomi rocks again‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èü§ûüèªmobile lags during pub g gameplay ,even it has fastest processing dissappointment from Redmi   camera also not as they said during launch  battery is good  I liked the fast charger very good charging capacity I found battery draining fast but over all good performance   excellent cemera  Amazing product from xiaomi selfie camera needs to improve and i think developers will improve camera quality by tweaking software through , other wise phone is must buy under 30k , stunning display powerful processor nd great battery life with triple camera at rear also upto mark  must buy a carbon black version so you can get the best premium experience in the market poor Wifi & network connectivity speed    Camera Function very good   Back camera excellent but front camera beautifies pictures by default  Face unlock slowSplendid phone indeed!

installed apps in seconds just awesome   \\U0001f970I have purchased this phone in the alpha sale  Firstly about the pricing, even I felt like it was overpriced, but anyway I bought it because I had no other options (didn\\'t want any other phone)  But after using it felt worth the price  I have used this phone for a week now, so I think I can point out some pros and cons of the phone   PS  All the photos are clicked using the GCam mod   PROS   1  The included 18 watt charger seems to be good enough unless you really need to own a faster charger   really awesome experience with one week using this phone good camera, awesome battery backup,nonstop ping awesome performance    not as expected after buygaming performance super charging fast and good battrey backup camera is avg in daylight and worst in low lightFACING MAJOR FRONT CAMER ISSUE  There is some problem with the front camera, see the pictures  The camera is not working properly and have checked with MI support team as well  in case you are using Glacier Blue, let me know if you are facing the problem as well or not  Also the camera has started making some noise as well  See the bottom corner and the blue light as well  This is not a filter guys  It\\'s the Glacier Blue Color camera quality is good battery backup is good phone performance is very smooth beautiful design  best quality smartphone by Redmi REAL FLAGSHIP KILLERThis is my first review on flipkart for any devices I have ever bought  The device look and feel is great, its snappy   Display is a treat to eyes would say Best for mobile devices The colors are accurate  ( 1080P+ will use less battery in comparison to qHD display of sam )  Camera is good and awesome when you use gCAM application ported for Mi9  good colors with HDR+ enabled   The main feature I like was the battery performance  it lost damn 9 5 hrs screen on time for full charge  This is m   To describe it in a single sentence, It is an Amazing mobile with awesome specs at reasonable price  now let me explain you pros and cons      pros  ->Build Quality   this time REDMI did a great job with build quality it comes with corning gorilla glass 5 front and back with aluminium frame so it looks premium when you hold it in hand  ->Display   FHD+ AMOLED display is just beautiful and visual experience is great -> Camera  rear camera(48mp+13mp+8mp) captures great pictures in all the depar   Great value for money phone  best camera and battery battery can run easily 1 5 days with heavy usage as well No doubt about performance as well with SD 855 it\\'s just amazing after two days of use all i can sey battery not up to the mark(drains quickly) but full points to the processor but still got heating problem after 1 or 2 games, build and finish very good, selfie camera in low light not satisfactory  redmi doesn\\'t give any assurance about future updategoodSimply awesome   pros  Display, battery,fast charging,Processor is beast  for PUBG u can play HDR and Extreme   cons  i didn\\'t like its Front camera, making photos so bright and fair, same like Vivo and Oppo phones I have written this review after using this phone for last 1 day  Pros  1  It has a fabulous display  2  It looks really premium in hands  3 When we charge full battery lasts for a day(only if u turn off auto-brightness and dual GPS system)  4  The phone speed is amazing bcz of its 855 processers    Cons  1  It heats up a little bit while charging and after playing two pubg game it heats up litely  2  The camera is good but needs to improve a bit  3  The fingerprint scanner works 8 out of 10    This phone is almost perfect   Few issues though  1) WhatsApp video call doesn\\'t work on full-screen 2) If you are using an app and get a phone call the name of the caller doesn\\'t display , only the phone number does  If anyone has any fixes for these issues kindly helpvalue for moneyJust go for itSimply awesome    after 5 days usage camera amazing   no words battery i get around two days with moderate usage  fingerprint response 8/10 case is very slippery   so try to buy another one popup camera motor is slow  but led light and popup sound make us to forget it speed performance no words    i cant feel any lag anywhere overall amazing   definitely a flagship killer love k20 proKiller phone from redmi  Worth buyingThe hype is real  snappy performance  butter smooth display mind blowing 3D design and guess what \"no ads\" its worth the price awesome phone with excellent cameraNo Question, one of the best phones out there  value for money  Loved It loveddd best gift from miphone is good but still have some software bugs little bit more costly     if u get in 26k it\\'s a super phonegoodoverpriced but value for money Really happy with my purchase  Design and build quality is good  compared to Redmik20, Pro version is heavier  Camera performance is ultimate  SD855 is tooo fast  opens all the installed apps in seconds just awesome   \\U0001f970I have purchased this phone in the alpha sale  Firstly about the pricing, even I felt like it was overpriced, but anyway I bought it because I had no other options (didn\\'t want any other phone)  But after using it felt worth the price  I have used this phone for a week now, so I think I can point out some pros and cons of the phone   PS  All the photos are clicked using the GCam mod   PROS   1  The included 18 watt charger seems to be good enough unless you really need to own a faster charger   really awesome experience with one week using this phone good camera, awesome battery backup,nonstop ping awesome performance    not as expected after buygaming performance super charging fast and good battrey backup camera is avg in daylight and worst in low lightFACING MAJOR FRONT CAMER ISSUE  There is some problem with the front camera, see the pictures  The camera is not working properly and have checked with MI support team as well  in case you are using Glacier Blue, let me know if you are facing the problem as well or not  Also the camera has started making some noise as well  See the bottom corner and the blue light as well  This is not a filter guys  It\\'s the Glacier Blue Color camera quality is good battery backup is good phone performance is very smooth beautiful design  best quality smartphone by Redmi REAL FLAGSHIP KILLERThis is my first review on flipkart for any devices I have ever bought  The device look and feel is great, its snappy   Display is a treat to eyes would say Best for mobile devices The colors are accurate  ( 1080P+ will use less battery in comparison to qHD display of sam )  Camera is good and awesome when you use gCAM application ported for Mi9  good colors with HDR+ enabled   The main feature I like was the battery performance  it lost damn 9 5 hrs screen on time for full charge  This is m   To describe it in a single sentence, It is an Amazing mobile with awesome specs at reasonable price  now let me explain you pros and cons      pros  ->Build Quality   this time REDMI did a great job with build quality it comes with corning gorilla glass 5 front and back with aluminium frame so it looks premium when you hold it in hand  ->Display   FHD+ AMOLED display is just beautiful and visual experience is great -> Camera  rear camera(48mp+13mp+8mp) captures great pictures in all the depar   Great value for money phone  best camera and battery battery can run easily 1 5 days with heavy usage as well No doubt about performance as well with SD 855 it\\'s just amazing after two days of use all i can sey battery not up to the mark(drains quickly) but full points to the processor but still got heating problem after 1 or 2 games, build and finish very good, selfie camera in low light not satisfactory  redmi doesn\\'t give
